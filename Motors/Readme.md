# Modelling of Motors

Folder contains modelling of DC, BLDC , and Stepper Motor. The model for the simulation for the respective motor are based on the following references:
1) DC - 
2) BLDC - http://webfiles.portal.chalmers.se/et/MSc/BaldurssonStefanMSc.pdf
3) Stepper Motor(Permanent and Hybrid) -

The Differential Equation are solved using the Euler Method, therefore special care has to be given to the delta_time variable as it should small to accurately solve the differentail equation.
